Houndsniff - Hash Identification Program - Version 1.5
By Michael Constantine Dimopoulos Sep 2020

Houndsniff is  a hash recognition  program
It works  by  extracting some  info  about
the  hash  and comparing it to  info about
other  hashes in an SQLite  database. Then,
it prints the matches sorted by popularity.
Their  popularity  is  determined  by  web
search  result  numbers  in  comparison to
to other  hashes  with  the  same features

If your hash includes a dollar sign ($), make
sure you place it in between quotes.
