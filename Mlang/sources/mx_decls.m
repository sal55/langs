!Declarations for M-Code scheme
!Terms:
! MCU		MCode Unit, binary code/data/imports/relocs for whole program (LIBREC)
! MCB		MCU rendered to flat data block, written out as .mx/.ml file
! MCX		MCU with allocations, imports and fixups done to make it ready to run
! LIB		Informal reference to MCU or MCX in-memory data; or to MX/ML file
!
! MCU is created from SS data (which normally was used to generate EXE)
! An MCU block is either converted to MCB which is then sent to an MX/ML file;
! or it is directly fixed up into MCX to allow immediate execution
!
! MCB can be read from a file into a memory block. MCB data contains a lineat
! set of tagged data blocks. Those blocks are scanned to form a normal MCU/LIBREC
! data-structure. That MCU can be fixed up like above to make it ready to be
! run or any function to be called.

end

! Explanation of reloc codes
! No reloc
!	For local call/jmp, which are /only/ within code segment, no fixups are needed
!
! Locabs32/Locabs64
!	Reloc field contains offset of location within target segment, plus any
!   constant offset (eg. A+3 has offset of A, plus 3)
!   Baseaddr of that segment is added to that offset
!
! Impabs32/64
!	Reloc field contains any local offset (eg. the 3 in A+3)
!	Symbol index is used (via xlate to global index) to get abs address of symbol
!   Reloc field is replaced with 32/64 bits of that address plus the original value
!
! Imprel32
!	Only used for imported names, and only for CALL. Reloc field may be zeros
!	Reloc field will be changed to relative offset thunk table at end of code segment
!	Thunk table (indexed by local import index), is populated with JMPs to values
!	stored in address table which follows immediately
!	That address table needs to be populated with abs addresses of those imports
!	(Calls to LIB rather than DLL can have CALL offset replaced with direct offset to the
!	imported function, provided top 31 bits of address are zero.)
