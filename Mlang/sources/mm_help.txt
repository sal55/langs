M Compiler Generating x64 native code - Windows Version

Whole-program compiler builds entire program from the lead module
into a executable file.

    mm main              # Create main.exe from lead module main.m
    mm main.m            # Same (.m extension is default)

Options:

    -exe                 # Generate .exe executable file (default)
    -asm                 # Generate intermediate ASM file only
    -ml                  # Generate .ml library file
    -mx                  # Generate .mx executable
    -run                 # Run program in-memory

    -opt                 # Apply simple optimiser

    -out:file            # Name of output file 

    -ma                  # Create .ma file combining source/support files
    -mas                 # Include also standard library sources
