## Language and Compiler Development

I develop a number of small-scale language-related projects on my PC.

This github site is used for associated resources such as source backups, or the odd binary. Most projects are written in my M language, but the master sources and development are on my home PC.

'M' is mostly used for compilers, interpreters, assemblers, emulators, and any support libraries that are needed.

### Current Set of Languages
````
HLLs:
'X'        Untitled new language
M          Lower level systems language (see below)
Q          Dynamic scripting language
C-subset   The partly non-standard subset of C used by the BCC/MCC projects

Internal Languages:
PCL        QQ Bytecode
PCL7       MM Intermediate language
PCL8       BB Intermediate language

Assembly Languages:
AA         x64-subset assembly using my syntax
ZA         Z80 assembly, with some tweaks on Zilog syntax

### Current Language Projects and Tools
````
Tool    Folder   Written in

BB      BX       M           M compiler for x64/Windows, streamlined version using PCL8
MM      MX       M           M compiler for x64/Windows using PCL7
QQ      QX       M           Bytecode compiler + interpreter for Q
AA      AX       M           Single-file assembler for x64-subset (currently shares MM backend)

MZ      ZX       M           M-subset compiler targeting Z80, based on PCL8
ZA      ZX       Q           Z80 Assembler
ZZ      ZX       M           Z80 Emulator
RUNZ    RX       M           Cutdown version of ZZ that compiles with MZ and can be run under ZZ

MC      MX       M           Transpiler from M to linear C, based on PCL7 output generated by MM front-end
BCC     CX       M           C-subset compiler using PCL7 intermediate language (shares backend with MM)
MCC     CX       M           Version of BCC configured for one output: ASM in 'GAS' format.
'CC'    DX       M           (No identity yet) Self-contained fork of MCC with all extraneous code removed.
                             This is intended as the basis for a version of MCC written in C

### M Language

This was first created in 1981 for Z80, and then evolved over several generations of x86 up to x64. There was recently an attempt to port it to ARM64, but that got abandoned.

It has steadily evolved, but has also been deliberately kept low level. It has been self-hosted (written in itself or a previous version) in a continuous chain going to back to the 1980s.

This has then been my primary language for over 40 years. However, I haven't done any commercial work with it since the early 2000s; it is just a hobby now.

I specialise now in small, single-file, self-contained and very fast compilers with minimal external dependencies.

M is basically C but with utterly different syntax, and several modern conveniences. See [M Features](Mfeatures.md).
