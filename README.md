```

N indicates the number of input files accepted. Only `bcc.exe`, and `aa.exe` because it was used to combine .asm outputs of BCC, accept multiple source files. All my own languages generally work from a single submitted module.

### Notes

**(1)** `PCL` was the name of the discrete IL I'd planned for the M compiler, and I also worked on an interpreter for it. But the project became too much and was dropped. The special M compiler `mmp.exe` and the interpreter `pci.exe` are retained as an independent project. I had ideas of using it as a debugging tool for M programs

**(2)** This was a project involving a Z80 assembler (completed), and an emulator (just started). It was shelved when I realised how much effort was needed to properly emulate Z80.

**(3)** `mmx.exe` is simply a renamed `mm.exe`. The M compiler checks the name of the executable, and if it is `mmx`, it will automatically invoke the `-run` option (and uses less verbose output, to make the compilation process transparent and the illusion of running a script language better)

**(4)** (See **7**) Because of problems with DLLs, I created my own simpler shared library format using `.ml` files. These are accepted by Q programs, but in M, can only be transparently used by `.mx` files, or accessed via a special API from regular `.exe`.

The format can also be used to write complete apps, with `.mx` extension, but being unknown to Windows, those must be started by a stub program `run.exe`

**(5)** The `-ma` option of M compiler combines all source files and support files (from `include` and `strinclude`) into a single file. This is easy to backup, transmit, copy etc. And it can be directly be compiled in that form: `mm prog.ma`.

**(6)** The `-qa` option does a similar job for Q programs, and there is is necessary for packaging applications, as there is no longer a binary file format for bytecode

**(7)** `mm.exe` used to produce DLL files, which could be relocated with the low 2GB of virtual address space. But sometimes it can be loaded higher, and I think that caused the problems I sometimes had. Loading above 2GB requires RIP-relative addressing, and other code-generation to choices to get around the problem of absolute addresses above 2GB not fitting into a 32-bit field. My code generators don't yet do that.

**(8)** OBJ files can still be produced by `aa.exe`, to allow combining with other software. But they need a third party linker, and these now like to create images that can also be loaded above 2GB. So at present DLL and OBJ outputs are shelved until I can sort that out.

**(9)** MS is a new project just started. Short for M-Script.

**(10)** BCC project is archived, and is retained as a test program for my M compiler.
