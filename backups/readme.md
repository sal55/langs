(Source backups via amalgamated source file bundles.)

The .ma files each represent one project, and are an amalgamation of its source files:
````
mm7.ma       is my 'M' systems language compiler, version 7
bb8.ma       is my 'M' systems language compiler, version 8
````

These ones were not generated by the mm/bb compiler, which would only have had the modules needed for that particular configuration.

Instead, a mm7.pro/bb8.pro/etc file is manually maintained in each project folder which contains all relevant modules for all configurations, including any that might be WIPs, plus project files , batch scripts and a few other bits.

Each amalgamation can be directly compiled by mm/bb, if first renamed to the lead module of the desired configuration (so mm7.ma becomes mm.ma, or bb8.ma is also mm.ma).

Alternatively, each .ma file can be expanded into its discrete files. This can be done with the BB compiler, for example:
````
  bb -decons bb8.ma
````
This writes the files into src\\\*.\*. It can also be done with a script as this text format is not that complicated (see contents).
