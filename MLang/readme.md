## 'M' and 'Q' Languages

These are my personal languages as of 2022:

**M** My systems programming language

**Q** My dynamic scripting language

**AA** My take on x64 assembly

The languages are small, simple, minimal, old-fashioned, amateurish and poorly implemented. Yet as personal tools I find them invaluable, and satisfying to refine and maintain.

I didn't intend to make working versions available to try out, but I do now have a downloads page. Like the languages themselves, this is an exercise in keeping this stuff minimal and effortless: either download a ready-to-use binary in one file, or build from source from a single file.
