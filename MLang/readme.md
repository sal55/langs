## 'M' and 'Q' Languages

These are my personal languages as of 2022:

**M** My systems programming language

**Q** My dynamic scripting language

**AA** My take on x64 assembly

The languages are small, simple, old-fashioned, amateurish and are poorly and minimally implemented. Yet as personal tools I find them invaluable, can tackle most of my programming tasks, and are satisfying to refine and maintain. 

I really, really, don't want to use C++. Or Rust. Or Python. Or even C.

I've decided that this modest set of references will be written with myself in mind as the primary audience, but I'll also be aware aware that others could be reading.

Downloads are available for anyone to try out, at their own risk. Nothing is supported, nothing is guaranteed. The Download page itself is an experiment in making such tools available as binaries or source bundles, with as little fuss as possible.
