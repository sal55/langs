#### Some Benchmarks

alex.lua, slex.lua are two simple lexers written in Lua. They have somewhat different code, as Lua doesn't have the features I need and I tried different things.

mlex.q is the same lexer in my Q interpreted language. This has lower-level features such as `switch` statements, and byte-pointers, and proper character literals.
