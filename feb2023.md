## Language Development 2023
 
 ### Overview of Products
 
 Product | Language | Description
 --- | --- | ---
 mm.exe | M | M Compiler (M is my static systems language)
 qq.exe | Q | Q Compiler/Interpreter (Q is my dynamic language)
 aa.exe | ASM | x64 subset assembler/linker
 (bcc.exe | C | C-subset compiler)
 
 All are implemented in the M language.
 
 ### New Language Development
 
Very little is envisaged in the languages themselves. The designs are pretty much fixed; the syntax is not going to change; the type systems will stay the same. That is, 1980s style which works perfectly fine for me.
  
What will be developed are the implementations, how the compilers/interpreters are organised and used. Some work is needed on the module scheme they both share, and how Q and M programs can work better together.

`qq.exe` I also found to be a little bloated, and full of baggage no longer needed. Its 750KB size, if not huge for a rich language, is still bigger than many lightweight interpreters. It needs an overhaul.

### Module Scheme 2023

With experience I've had of the 2021 scheme, I've decided to simplify this:

* Remove conditional elements that have never really been used
* Possibly remove explicit system module directives
* Wrap the header elements (the project directives) in an `imports...end` block to simplify access via external scripts, and for a better-defined boundary between header code and normal program code.

This applies to both languages, but may do Q first.

### M Compiler Changes

The current M6 version uses ad hoc code generation, to turn AST3 into MCL (the x64 representation), eliminating the 'PCL' IL of M5. It also drops the small optimiser of M5.

But I feel that a more abstract intermediate form is needed. I don't want code converting AST nodes to worry about the details of register allocation, yet neither do I really need a complete IL like before.

So I'm trying an experimental approach:

* Start with the MCL language whose opcodes (not the pseudo ops), map directly to x64 instructions
* Add a segregated set of extra, higher level and more abstract opcodes; I will call this set PCL
* This new set doesn't use registers, but a virtual, compile-time operand stack
* An extra pass will be needed to expand those to concrete MCL instructions with full registers

This could work better than a discrete PCL IL, since half the codes (for declarations, comments, labels etc) do the same thing on both. This new PCL opcode works only with expressions.

#### Optimiser

M5 had a small optimiser, consisting of keeping some locals and parameters in registers. It worked well for benchmarks, but for real applications with scattered control flow and heavy use of globals, the advantages were limited, so it was dropped.

However, sometimes Q programs call into M functions for speedups. There, all the action is inside that function, and it will mainly work with locals.

So the optimiser may be reinstated as here it can have worthwhile benefits.

#### C Compiler

This uses ad hoc methods as well, and the code in the compiler is an appalling mess. If the above works, then possibly it may be retrofitted to the `bcc` project. It would also make it fully ABI-compliant as it isn't right now.

### Q Implementation

My script languages have largely done their own thing for 30 years, which included having discrete bytecode files, and separate compile/run steps. Until a a few years ago when I decided to integrate those into one product.

This has some advantages: everything is run-from-source, so is always up-to-date. And there are no untidy binary files about.

But, my 750KB interpreter is quite heavyweight. Now, 300KB of that are bundled libraries, but 450KB is quite a bit too. So I am looking at splitting again into two programs: `qc.exe`, the bytecode compiler, and `pc.exe`, the bytecode intepreter.

The advantage is being able to ship finished apps as a single binary .pc file, instead of a .qa file which is an amalgamation of source and support files, and which needs a compiler. Being a rich language, that is quite heavyweight.

However I will also need a way to emulate that run-from-source (after all `mm.exe` can do run from source; it would be ironic if my systems language had it, but not my scripting one!). Creating a batch file for that won't cut it.

For this, I will look at making more use of ML files.

### ML Library Files

`mm.exe` can produce 'ML' library files in a private binary format. These replace the use of DLLs in my apps, which are buggy. At present they are little used; mainly used for Q programs needing to run M code.

One use however is to replace the current `qq.exe` interpreter. `qc.exe` (bytecode compiler) can be configured as `qc.ml`, a library version, and `pc.exe` as `pc.ml`, the bytecode interpreter.

`qq.exe` can import `qc.ml/pc.ml` (see **note**). Because they will share the same environment as the host program, it is easy for `qc.ml` to return a bytecode data structure, and pass it directly to `pc.ml`. (DLL makes that a bit harder; they can contain their own instances of the C runtime for example, and allocated pointers are not compatible.)

Anyway, new `qq.exe` will be able to run `.q` programs with no intermediate `.pc` files generated.

**Note** EXE files can't automatically import `ml` files (I may rename to `mc`; see below), as the OS doesn't know about them. I need to
do this manually. Or emulate `qq.exe` as a combination of `run.exe` and `qq.mx`, which can import `.ml` easily.

It sounds messy, so something else that needs to tidied up. Another problem is that MX files are 20% bigger than equivalent EXE files due to having extra relocation info, but I'm trying to make this stuff smaller!

I might after all just statically compile the sources codes together; the module 'subprogram' scheme makes that easy. This can be for a one-off build of `qq.exe` so it doesn't matter if unwieldly.

### Q Applications

Binary .pc files is a step forward, but an app still needs a Q interpreter, `pc.exe`. And also, some Q apps may make use of M functions for some aspects, for things that need to run fast. So an application may involve `pc.exe`, `app.pc` and `app.ml`.

I've yet to work it out in detail, but probably the final application will be a single file `app.exe`, which incorporates the M functions, but also has a driver front end which invokes `pc.ml` with `app.pc`. I will have to see how best to bundle these two extra files within app.exe to give the illusion of a self-contained executable.

### File Extensions and MX/ML

I might make some changes here too. Currently `mm.exe` generates binaries as `.exe`, or as `.mx` or `.ml`. Those last are my own formats; `mx` is for complete executables, `ml` is for libraries used for M or Q applications.

Since the OS doesn't know about `mx`, I need a small stub program, currently called `run.exe`, to execute `mx` programs. `ml` libraries can only be used automatically from `mx` files (for DLL, the OS loader does the fixups).

I'm considering renaming so that there are parallels between my M and Q languages. Under the new scheme, both `.mx` and `.ml` will use `.mc` instead:

Language | Compiler | Output file | Run program | Run example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
M | `mm.exe` | `fred.exe` | None (OS-loaded) | `fred` or `fred.exe`
M | `mm.exe -mc` | `fred.mc` | `mc.exe` | `mc fred`
Q | `qc.exe`     | `fred.pc` | `pc.exe` | `pc fred`

* `mc.exe` runs `.mc` x64 executables, renamed from `run.exe`; `pc.exe runs `.pc` binary bytecode
* Currently `mc.exe` is used for the M compiler that transpiles to C; perhaps change that to `mcc.exe`.
* `.mc` format is primarily for libraries. Those can be used directly from Q, but from M, can only be automatically loaded from an `mc` program, or another `mc` library.

Currently `.pc` files cannot be used as Q libraries (so that Q apps can consist of more than one bytecode file). It's easier to instead import the lead module and compile in as source code. But the idea of distributing .pc as separate, importable binaries is good; I will have to think about it.

Lots of useful combinations that can be used to create tidy hybrid Q and M appications.

### MA and QA Files

These are the single file amalgamations that can be produced by either product. The file contains all sources and text files needed to build a complete program. A year ago I simplified the format: just concatenating files, each with a header line containing its name.

That format allows minor editing, and reasonably simple extraction with a script. But it has some some issues:

* Header lines start with "===". That is not a problem with source files, but could conceivably occur with support files, if they contain such a line
* Binary files cannot be included. This would be a problem if `bininclude` was used in M, or `strinclude` with Q is the file was binary.
* Reading it into a compiler is not hard, but a little more fiddly than I would like

I may therefore revert to an older format, where the start of the file is a directory listing the files, and the offsets and sizes of the sections in the rest of the file. Binary files can be included (but may still cause problems if viewing with a text editor).

### Function Tables

This is a feature of M compiler when tables of all functions used are built-in to the EXE file. It's very useful for building tables of handlers at runtime, without needing to maintain tables manually.

But I've just discovered it can increase EXE files by 10%. So I will look at changing that feature, so that only selected functions are listed.

That will require a syntax update, and revising my codebase. 10% is just too significant: it's more than the savings in code size my modest optimiser achieves.


### Progress Updates

What has actually been done:

* M: I've started generated hybrid MCL/PCL code in `mm.exe`. Enough works to get started on that new pass to turn PCL ops into MCL
* Q: By removing all optional stuff (eg. diagnostic modules), the smallest `qq.exe` (still the current composite program) is 383KB. (Or 359KB using the M5 optimising compiler, but I will use M6 for comparisons.)
* An experimental split has suggested that the compile-only `qc.exe` will be under 250KB. It can produce internal PCL bytecode.
* The next step there is to devise a PC bytecode binary format, likely based on what I used before; to generate discrete PC files; and writing a utility program to display those files.
