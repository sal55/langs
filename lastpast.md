I back-pedaled on which language I'd thought hadn't yet got around to self-hosting.

Yes, I could have gone online to fully research my one-line quip, but I didn't; so shoot me.

My comment about Rust originally being written in something else was supposed to be a comparison with RustScript, the subject of this thread: RustScript is not written in Rust; neither was Rust at one point.

But now, folks, that is no longer true: github will tell you that 97.6% of the sources on that project - not including LLVM (all the fiddly bits) - are in Rust.

Jolly good for them.

Phew!

(And this has cost me a dozen downvotes. What a lovely, tolerant community!)
