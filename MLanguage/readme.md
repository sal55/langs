## M Language

This was first created in 1981 for Z80, and then evolved over several generations of x86 up to x64. There was recently an attempt to port it to ARM64, but that got abandoned.

It has steadily evolved, but has also been deliberately kept low level. It has been self-hosted (written in itself or a previous version) in a continuous chain going to back to the 1980s.

This has then been my primary language for over 40 years. However, I haven't done any commercial work with it since the early 2000s; it is just a hobby now.

M is basically C but with utterly different syntax, and several modern conveniences. See [M Features](Mfeatures.md).
